# (Automated?) Differential analysis of viral protein sequence variants interactions with host proteins 

We have started to develop a flexible analysis of molecular interfaces between 2 arbitrary sets of residues in a tertiary or quaternary structure involving protein, RNA, DNA, small molecules. 
 It is especially aimed at studying in detail molecular interactions at the atom or residue level.  
We can already compare SARS-CoV-1/SARS-CoV-2 interaction networks with ACE2 interactively  for example, or with other beta coronaviruses variants, but we should aim at developing an automated differential binding analysis.   Any other case can be envisioned, yet an outcome of this hackathon project is to develop a general method and provide a useful analysis to the community studying SARS-CoV-2 at the root of the COVID-19 pandemic.
